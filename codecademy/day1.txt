HTML&CSS:

We can write CSS inside of HTML but this is not really good for fix problem
using <? style="??;"> remember the ; character
or using ?{??; ??} this style. yes, its the CSS style.
<link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
	this is the link for HTML into CSS the last element is checker
<p class="">HTML | .class{} CSS
<p class="a b">HTML | .a{} .b{} CSS class can be seperate in CSS
<h1 id="a">HTML | #a CSS this is bad because id can't be seperate IT IS SPECIFIC
!important CSS the most specific one. better not use it.
!important > id > class > tags(h1 etc.)
	!important will override id and so on...
.main li CSS
	can be use for something(nested elements) under the class
	list-style: square; different from other FOCUS ON LI element
.main p vs #p   the winner is #p more specific
h1, main{} is different from hi.main{} first is two seperate second is specific
