every function should be PURE FUNCTION.(pure function)
no effect to any global variables or other functions

RULE No.1	Don't change global variable when use function this called side effect #副作用
RULE No.2	Use the arguments to make function flexible
RULE No.3	functions are class objects in javascript try modify prototype

.prototype.forEach()
		like a for loop search every element for a array or objects

HARD-TIME now try tommorow maybe
